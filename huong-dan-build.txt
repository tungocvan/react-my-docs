Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  `npm start`
    Starts the development server.

  `npm run build`
    Bundles your website into static files for production.

  `npm run serve`
    Serves the built website locally.

  `npm run deploy`
    Publishes the website to GitHub pages.

We recommend that you begin by typing:

  `cd my-docs`
  `npm start`

Happy building awesome websites!
